# ISO/IEC 27001:2013 Information Security Management System (ISMS)

## _Why_?

Security of people's data stored in IT systems is _critical_ for _every_ organization.

### Our _purpose_ for creating this repo

To ensure that both _we_ (_the DWYL team_) and our _stakeholders_ (_people who use our app(s) for their business-critical or personal information_) have the _confidence_ in our IT systems/process.

## _What_?

The [**ISO 27001:2013 _Standard_**](http://www.iso.org/iso/iso27001) defines requirements for the **confidentiality**, **integrity** and **availability** of information systems.

It's meant to _help_ people (_in organizations_)
think about and implement "_controls_" which improve IT security.

For comprehensive details see: http://www.iso27001security.com/html/27001.html


## _Who_?

***All people*** in the organization who have contact with Information Technology or data should be given training on IT security. There's no excuse for "_naivety_" or "_ignorance_".

## _How_?

Even though ISO 27001 is a "_standard_", _annoyingly_ it is **not _free_**, instead we have to _pay_ to download it! It [costs **CHF 118**](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=54534) (_£92 at the time of writing_).
