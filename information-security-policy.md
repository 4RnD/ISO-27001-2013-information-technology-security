Note: Any additional people who are relevant/interested/available will be invited closer to the time.

### Ad-Hoc Review

The policies may be updated in response to a change in systems or service providers.

When a new technology or system is introduced into the company
e.g. a new piece of hardware or 3<sup>rd</sup> party service provider is
being considered we will review the requirements of the policies contained
herein and ensure compliance.

Where an amendment is required it will _first_ be discussed in an "_issue_"
- if a _formal_ meeting is required it will be scheduled - and the _outcome_
of the discussion will be recorded/reflected in this policy document.
